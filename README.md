- 👋 Hi, I’m @the0n0, I´m a junior dev at C++, Phyton, Rust and CSS.
- 👀 I’m interested in how does the Android software works and how does bloatware affects the systems worldwide.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, JavaScript and C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with either Microsoft or Google to develop lots of tools to help other devs.
- 📫 How to reach me, quite simple, since I´m also a gamer, my tag (worldwide) is @iamthe0n0_bat
